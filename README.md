# My bucket list
Just a random repo of all my thoughts, code, experiments and tests that I want to keep up to date and try.

I don't always have the ability at work to experiment and learn new languages or theories so I created this account and repos to do those such things. For instance maybe I don't use Java enough at work but want to keep trying things in Java while I'm working in other languages I touch everyday like C# and Python.
